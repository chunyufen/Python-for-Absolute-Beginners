![](readme_resources/absolute-beginners-book-cover-sm.jpg)



Roger and I are working on a book to accompany this course. As part of this repo, we want to make sure everyone has access to the full resolution images use as figures. They appear here now, a bit ahead of the release of the book.

If you want to get notified of the book launch, be sure to [**join our mailing list at Talk Python**](https://training.talkpython.fm/getnotified).
